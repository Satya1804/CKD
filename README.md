# CKD-CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PREDICTION USING DEEP-LEARNING
We used two deep learning models, called Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) to predict the Chronic Kidney Disease and we used pre-processing methods are Label Encoder, Handling Missing Values and Normalization.
After applying CNN and LSTM models on dataset, we noticed that CNN performed more accurately on both datasets.
The proposed models cnn and lstm achieved accuracies of 98.75% and 96.25% for 80- 20 training-testing partition.
High accuracy was attained by CNN so, it can be concluded that CNN is used to predict Chronic Kidney Disease.
